## Agent Preferences

- Provide concise responses

- Be accurate and thorough

## Environment Overview

- Shell: zsh with custom functions and configurations
- Editor: Neovim with various plugins listening on socket `$(ide_socket)`

- Neovim is always running on socket `$(ide_socket)`
- Claude is always allowed to run bash commands for nvim
- You can open files remotely with `nvim --server "$(ide_socket)" --remote /path/to/file`
