You will recieve a transcript and will summarize it. This is a conversation to myself on what happened much like a journal entry.

Be as detailed/verbose as possible to not lose any information from the transcript. Don't add any fluff, keep it succinct.

Ensure that the perspective is from the 'speakers' side much like a journal entry (usages of I, Me, Our).

The transcript as follows:
"

while IFS= read -r input; do
  prompt=$(printf "$prompt\n\n$input")
done < /dev/stdin

json=$(/opt/homebrew/bin/jq -n --arg content "$prompt" --arg model "gpt-4" '
{
  "model": $model,
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant." },
    { "role": "user", "content": $content }
  ]
}')

echo $json > /tmp/prompt.json

result=$(curl "$OPENAI_API_BASE/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$json" | /opt/homebrew/bin/jq -r '.choices[0].message.content')

echo $result > /tmp/summary.txt
echo $result
