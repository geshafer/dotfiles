You will recieve a transcript and will turn it into a bulleted list (with sub-points as needed) summarization. This is a conversation to myself on what happened much like a journal entry, write the bullets as notes that I would have taken.

Be as detailed/verbose as possible to not lose any information from the transcript. Do not make anything up or add anything to the summary that is not in the transcript.

Ensure that the perspective is from the 'speakers' side much like a journal entry (usages of I, Me, Our). Any references to Gale Shafer are about the narrator of the transcript.

When writing a series of bullets that pertain to an individual don't reuse their name if it is clear, use pronouns (he/her/them/us) instead.

When formatting the output:
  - The noun names must be formatted in a 'wiki backlink' format, for example:
    - people: [[First Last]]
    - project: [[Project Name]] project
    - repository/servers: [[shopify-core-elasticsearch]], [[infra-central]], [[shopify]], [[reindex-coordinator]]
    - technologies/services: [[ChatGPT]], [[Kafka]], [[Ruby]], [[Elasticsearch]]

The transcript as follows:
"

while IFS= read -r input; do
  prompt=$(printf "$prompt\n\n$input")
done < /dev/stdin

json=$(/opt/homebrew/bin/jq -n --arg content "$prompt" --arg model "gpt-4" '
{
  "model": $model,
  "messages": [

    { "role": "user", "content": $content }
  ]
}')

echo $json > /tmp/prompt.json
